Nice — clear brief. Below is a single, long requirements + design + execution document you can hand to an engineer or an agent. It’s written for a single-page FastAPI app (Python) using templating and CDN front-end assets (no heavy build step). It includes: required documents, functional & non-functional requirements, UI/UX & content spec (to match your screenshot), data & validation rules, security / privacy, testing & acceptance criteria, deployment checklist, and — at the end — an execution prompt you can paste to an agent to build the app.

Project Overview

Create a single-page web app (index) that replicates the “Success / transfer receipt” UI from the screenshot. The page should let a user enter transfer details in a simple form (recipient name, amount, bank, account number), submit, and see a modal-style success receipt that replaces the content with the same layout/typography as the screenshot. Backend should be Python + FastAPI with server-side rendering (Jinja2). Front-end assets loaded via CDNs (no bundler, no heavy build). Deliverables are text/design/execution documents and a requirement that generated code be easily deployable.

Documents you need (list)

1. Project Requirements & Acceptance Criteria (this file covers that).


2. UI/Content Specification — exact strings, microcopy, button labels, image asset details, fonts.


3. Data & Validation Rules — fields, types, formats, error messages.


4. API Spec — (single POST endpoint) request/response schema.


5. Security Checklist — TLS, CSRF considerations, input sanitization, logging policy.


6. Testing Matrix — automated + manual test cases (unit, integration, accessibility).


7. Deployment Guide — steps for Docker + simple hosting (e.g., Railway/Heroku), environment variables.


8. Developer Handoff / Readme — how to run locally, install requirements, environment.


9. Accessibility Report — key accessibility decisions and conformance targets (WCAG 2.1 AA).


10. Design Assets — small asset pack: avatar image (or placeholder) used in modal, optional SVG close icon, favicon.




---

Functional requirements

1. Single page: / (index) renders a form plus placeholder area that will show receipt after submission.


2. Form fields:

Recipient full name (string) — required.

Amount (decimal, positive) — required, currency prefix NGN.

Bank name (string) — required (free text or dropdown).

Account number (string / numeric) — required, digits only, length between 6–20 (configurable).

Optional: reference / note (string).



3. Submit: a single button (e.g., “Transfer”).


4. On submit:

Server validates input.

If invalid: redisplay form with inline error messages.

If valid: respond with the success modal / receipt view that visually replaces the main content (exact layout like screenshot).



5. Receipt view:

Large avatar image centered top.

Big heading: Success.

Body copy (exact template):
You have successfully transferred NGN{amount} to {recipient_name}
Bank Name: {bank}
Account Number: {account_number}

Two large red buttons below: OK and Share (use same style).

Close (“X”) in top-right.

OK returns to empty form (or form in original state). Share triggers the browser share API if supported, otherwise copies a share text to clipboard and shows a toast.



6. No user accounts — this is a UI demo only (no persistence required). Optionally log transfers to server console (not persistent).


7. Design match: typography scale, centering, white modal with rounded corners, spacing as per screenshot.




---

Non-functional requirements

1. Framework: FastAPI + Jinja2 templates.


2. Python version: 3.10+.


3. Dependencies: minimal. Example: fastapi, uvicorn, jinja2, python-multipart (if needed), pydantic (built-in to FastAPI).


4. Front-end: Use CDN fonts and a lightweight CSS framework (Tailwind CDN or Bootstrap CDN) or plain CSS. Prefer Tailwind via CDN for quick utility classes. Optionally include Google Fonts (Inter or Roboto) via CDN.


5. Rendering: server-side rendering only — no heavy JS build. Use minimal JS for modal actions, copy/share.


6. Accessibility: Use semantic HTML, aria attributes for modal, keyboard focus trapping in modal, labels for inputs, contrast ratio >= 4.5:1 for important text.


7. Performance: under 100 KB of custom CSS where possible; CDN assets loaded with integrity attributes optional.


8. Security: serve over HTTPS in production, validate and sanitize inputs, avoid storing any sensitive data, do not log full account numbers. Mask account number when storing logs (e.g., show last 4 digits only).


9. Deployability: runnable via uvicorn main:app --reload locally; Dockerfile optional for production.

UI / Layout / Content spec (exact text)

Page title: Transfer Demo

Form labels and placeholders:

Recipient name: Recipient name — placeholder: e.g., Oluwadamilola Deborah Ido...

Amount: Amount (NGN) — placeholder: 20000

Bank name: Bank name — placeholder: Opay

Account number: Account number — placeholder: 7056172558


Submit button: Transfer

Receipt / modal text EXACT (template):

Heading: Success

Paragraph: You have successfully transferred NGN{amount} to {recipient_name}
Bank Name: {bank}
Account Number: {account_number}


Buttons on receipt:

Primary: OK (red, fills width)

Secondary: Share (red, same style stacked)


Close icon: X top right.


Spacing, layout, color:

Modal background: white, large rounded corners.

Modal centered vertically & horizontally.

Buttons: bright red (#E60000 or similar), white text, large pill or rounded rectangle matching screenshot.

Font: use Google Font Inter or Roboto for rounded friendly look. Size scale: heading ~28–34px bold, body ~16px regular, buttons ~18–20px.



---

Validation rules (detailed)

Recipient name:

Required, min length = 2, max = 100.

Allow letters, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes. If other characters present show: Name contains invalid characters.


Amount:

Required. Numeric. Decimal allowed with up to two decimals.

Must be > 0 and <= configurable max (e.g., 1,000,000).

Format display: comma separators optional; show with NGN prefix on receipt.

Error messages: Enter a valid amount or Amount must be greater than 0.


Bank name:

Required. Free text or from dropdown if later implemented.

Min length 2, max 60.


Account number:

Required. Only digits allowed. Min length 6, max length 20.

Error: Account number must be digits only.


On server-side validation errors: return HTTP 422 or render form with inline errors. Client-side JS should also validate to improve UX.



---

API Spec (single endpoint)

GET / — render index form.

POST /transfer — accepts form-encoded data (or JSON if using fetch).

Request schema (form fields): name, amount, bank, account.

Response:

On validation error: render form with errors.

On success: render the receipt view (server returns full HTML page containing receipt).


Example success response: HTML page showing receipt with populated fields.



(If you want SPA behavior later, you can return JSON and render modal client-side; for now keep it server-rendered.)


---

Front-end assets (CDNs & suggested resources)

Google Fonts for typography: https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;700&display=swap

Tailwind CDN (play-cdn) for utility classes: https://cdn.tailwindcss.com — fast for prototypes.

Alternative: Bootstrap 5 CDN if you prefer ready components.


Small JS for copy/share: plain vanilla JS snippet; use Navigator share() if available; fallback to Clipboard API.

Avatar image: include a local /static/img/avatar.png or link to a placeholder CDN. Use alt="avatar".



---

Accessibility & internationalization notes

Modal: role="dialog", aria-modal="true", aria-labelledby for Success heading.

Ensure tabindex and focus trap: on show, focus first focusable element (OK button), on close return focus to the Transfer button.

Keyboard: Esc closes modal.

Screen reader: When modal opens, announce success message (use aria-live="polite" if necessary).

Currency formatting: use NGN prefix and numeric formatting consistent with locale en-NG if available.



---

Security & privacy

Do not persist raw account numbers. If storing logs, mask showing only last 4 digits.

Input sanitation: server-side validation using Pydantic models in FastAPI.

CSRF: since the page uses server-rendered forms, consider CSRF protection if deploying behind forms POST (FastAPI has no built-in CSRF — note for production).

HTTPS required in production.

No authentication required for this demo.

Limit logs for sensitive fields.



---

Testing & QA checklist

Manual tests:

1. Submit valid form -> shows receipt with correct values.


2. Submit invalid amount (negative, non-number) -> inline error.


3. Submit invalid account (letters) -> inline error.


4. Click OK -> returns to cleared form.


5. Click Share on desktop -> copies share text if share API unsupported.


6. Modal keyboard navigation: Tab order, Esc closes, focus returns.


7. Mobile: modal scales correctly, Share triggers native share if present.



Automated tests (suggested):

Unit tests for Pydantic validation model.

Integration test via TestClient for POST /transfer success & failure status codes.

Snapshot test to ensure receipt HTML contains expected strings.

Accessibility audit (axe or pa11y) to check focusable elements and ARIA.



---

Logging, Monitoring & Error handling

Log at INFO level for form submissions (but mask account numbers).

On server errors, show friendly error page: Something went wrong. Try again later. Do not reveal stack traces.

Optionally store non-sensitive telemetry: IP + timestamp (privacy note: only if permitted).



---

Deployment checklist

1. Create requirements.txt:

fastapi

uvicorn[standard]

jinja2 (if not included)

python-multipart (for form parsing)



2. Dockerfile (optional) with Python 3.10 base, copy code, install requirements, run uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT.


3. Environment variables: PORT, optional APP_ENV=production.


4. Ensure static files are served (FastAPI StaticFiles mount).


5. Use HTTPS in production (handled by platform or reverse proxy).


6. Minimal Procfile for Heroku if needed: web: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT.




---

Acceptance criteria (what “done” looks like)

A repository with a main.py (FastAPI) and templates/index.html implementing the form and receipt.

All front-end assets via CDN; no build step required.

Form validation performed server-side; sample client-side validation acceptable.

Receipt UI visually aligned to screenshot: avatar, Success heading, three-line body, two red buttons.

Basic accessibility: modal role, keyboard handling.

README with run and deploy instructions.

Tests: at least 3 unit/integration tests covering happy and unhappy paths.



---

Minimal file list to deliver

main.py — FastAPI app with routes (GET /, POST /transfer).

templates/index.html — Jinja2 template for the page and modal.

static/ — small CSS overrides (optional), avatar image.

requirements.txt

Dockerfile (optional)

README.md — how to run locally and test.

Execution prompt (paste this to an agent / generator)

Use this exact prompt (copy-paste) if you want an agent to generate the project code & files from the requirements above. It is self-contained:

You are an engineer. Build a minimal single-page FastAPI web app (Python 3.10+) meeting the following specification:

- Purpose: a demo "transfer success" single page. No database, no authentication.
- Tech stack: FastAPI, Jinja2 server-side templates, minimal JS. Use CDN assets (Google Fonts and Tailwind CDN) — no build step.
- Routes:
  - GET / -> render index with transfer form.
  - POST /transfer -> validate inputs and on success render the success receipt view (server-rendered HTML) that replaces the main content. On validation error re-render form with inline messages.
- Form fields & validation:
  - name (required; 2-100 chars; letters/spaces/hyphens/apostrophes only)
  - amount (required; numeric >0; up to two decimals)
  - bank (required; 2-60 chars)
  - account (required; digits only; length 6-20)
- Receipt view appearance MUST match the attached screenshot:
  - Centered white modal, rounded corners, top avatar image, heading "Success", body with:
    "You have successfully transferred NGN{amount} to {recipient_name}"
    "Bank Name: {bank}"
    "Account Number: {account_number}"
  - Two stacked red buttons: "OK" and "Share".
  - Close "X" top-right.
  - Buttons should be full-width modal-level buttons sized like the screenshot.
- Actions:
  - OK: returns user to the cleared form state.
  - Share: use Web Share API if available; otherwise copy share text to clipboard and show a small toast.
- Accessibility: modal role="dialog", aria-modal="true", keyboard close with Esc, focus trap while open.
- Security: server-side validation; when logging mask account numbers (show last 4 digits only).
- Deliverables:
  - main.py, templates/index.html, static assets (avatar), requirements.txt, Dockerfile (optional), README with run/deploy instructions, and tests (test_app.py).
- Keep dependencies minimal: fastapi, uvicorn, jinja2, python-multipart for form parsing, pytest for tests.
- Use Tailwind CDN or Bootstrap CDN + Google Fonts (Inter or Roboto).
- Add 3 automated tests using TestClient: successful transfer (200 and response contains "Success"), invalid amount, invalid account.
- Include instructions to run locally:
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - `uvicorn main:app --reload`
- Do not add user accounts or persistent DBs.

Produce the project files and a short README. Focus on a clean, minimal implementation that exactly follows the UI copy and layout described.
